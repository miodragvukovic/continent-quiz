Continent Quiz Test

Aprox time spent ~ 7 working hours.

Test: Simple quiz app based on provided api.

Test requirements:

  Home page show highest 3 scores from local storage, with date they were achieved.
  
  Generating 3 random continents from api, continents cannot be repeated. ( api endpoint havent got grouped objects, need to grup them locally ).
  
  Generating random correct answer within 3 previously chosen continents with random image for that continent ( flexible, amount of objects in api can be increased, decreased it wouldnt effect the application ).
  
  Verification on user interaction, right/wrong answer, points counting ( without displaying any data in browser, javascript is handling event ).
  
  Next question event, counting score points and questions answered, limiting to requested amount.
  
  After last question, result page, adding new score to local storage.
  
  Added couple of smooth small animations to make it more eye-appealing, nothing too fancy.
